### Zipfs Law 

This is the first assignment from the **computational linguistics** lecture at **Saarland University** during the **WS 2021/21**. In this exercise Zipf's law has been implemented and verified. Zipf's Law states that when words are ranked by their frequency, the frequency of 
a particular observation is inversely proportional to its rank. For each corpus a list of unique words was computed and sorted by descending frequency. Matplotlib was used to plot the frequency curves for the corpora, one plot with linear axes and another one with log-log axes. 

*Data sets:*

- King James Bible 
- The Jungle Book 
- SETIMES Turkish-Bulgarian parallel newspaper text


### Random Text Generation

This exercise is a reimplementation of the “Dissociated Press” system, aiming at generating random text from an n-gram model over a corpus.
Based on this system a number of text samples, 100 words in length per each, was produced. N was varied from 2 to 4. 

*Data set:*

- War and Peace
