# Zipfs Law 

Zipf's Law states that when words are ranked by their frequency, the frequency of a particular observation is inversely proportional to its rank

In this exercise Zipf's law has been implemented and verified based on the following freely available corpora:

- King James Bible (in Moodle)
- The Jungle Book (in Moodle)
- SETIMES Turkish-Bulgarian parallel newspaper text

For each corpus, compute a list of unique words was sorted by descending frequency. Matplotlib was used to plot the frequency curves for the corpora, one plot with linear axes and another one with log-log axes
