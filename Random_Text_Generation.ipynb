    "## Findings ##\n",
    "Since not only the frequency of words is important for the generation of the text, but also the context in which the words appear, two corpora, the King James Bible and Tolstois' \"War and Peace\" were generated, varying ngrams from 2 to 4. Using bigrams and especially trigrams a significant improvement in the quality of the generated text can be observed. The wider the ngram range is set, i.e. the larger the context involved, the more precisely words can be classified, which has a positive impact on the readability of the text. That is because with bigrams and especially trigrams longer continuous text sequences can be generated as such, for instance compund words and multi-word expressions, thus maintaining a their meaning and part of the sentence structure."
